# Dynamic-Neural-Network
Purely Python3-based user customizable (depth and width of neurons) Deep Neural Network. Automatic forward and backward propagation using fundamental mathematics.

* Programmed a Multi-Layered Perceptron using Python code only.
* User can define the number of:
  * Input and Output Neurons
  * Hidden Layers
  * Neurons in each Hidden Layer.
* Forward and backward propagation equations are automatically calculated and implemented.
